# What is NodeJS
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime for the server which uses Google's V8 engine. The engine, which is written in C++, compiles the JavaScript code into Machine Code.

NodeJS provides added features such as interacting with the file system. JavaScript in the browser doesn't have this functionality because it would pose a security risk.

## JavaScript on the Server
1. Create server and listen to incoming requests
2. Handle requests, validate input, connect to database, etc.
3. Return response (HTML, JSON, etc.)
